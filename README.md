## üíñNeed A Remote Job
**I am planning to quit my job and if anyone can offer a long term remote job, please contact me. All my skills and frameworks are free to use if a partnership is reached.**

-----

## üõ°Ô∏è Announcements

**techUI-Lite framework is completely free, free to use without restrictions, its core files are non-open source and published on NPM server**

**If you find this framework helpful to you, please give me a star, I will be more motivated to develop more free frameworks. I have so many great ideas.**

**If the number of stars reaches 500, I will transplant the premium version of adaptivePanel to the lite version.**

There is also a paid Premium version, which provides more powerful features, related documentation and demos please visit here [TechUI-Premium](https://techui.net/docs)

Note: The SVG material and code in the framework are limited to use in the framework, please do not extract them for other purposes.

The author started to learn React on August 1, 2023, and completed the React learning task by mid-August. In order to consolidate React knowledge, the TechUI-Lite framework was reconstructed. Functionally consistent with TechUI-Vue3-Lite. This refactoring took about two weeks, the Wasm module is consistent with the Techui-Vue3 version, which was previously developed in Rust language.

Since the author has been developing independently, the TypeScript language is hardly used in front-end development. However, when building this framework, TypeScript was used. For the complex configuration of ECharts charts and GeoJSON for maps, the author was confused about the types of these elements, so he used part "any" when defining the types of these elements. The author is not sure if this is the best practice for TypeScript development.

The framework was refactored in React in just two weeks, so there may be some bugs. If there are users to use it, I will spend time on it and continue to iterate and improve it. If not many people use it, then I will focus on learning Python. 

For the documentation part, please refer to the version of [Techui-Vue3-Lite Docs](https://lite.techui.net/docs) temporarily, and the framework of the React version is basically not much different in use.

## ‚ú®Features

- **üñ•Ô∏èFull port adaptation**

   Perfect ratio adaptation solution, personal computer, mobile phone, tablet, enterprise splicing screen, it can be said that most terminal devices can be perfectly adapted.

- **üõ∏Free Development Unlimited**

   Using popular technology stacks such as vite and react, by calling self-developed components and chart components, it can be quickly deployed and launched without too much tedious development process, which greatly shortens the development cycle. It has truly achieved free development at the source code level.

- **üìäEnterprise Splicing Screen**

   In the face of enterprise-level splicing screens, we have a lot of display solutions, which can be customized and developed according to the customer's splicing screen equipment. The best display effect can be achieved under any device.

- **üß©De-bitmapping full use of Dynamic SVG**

   Comprehensive vectorization (de-bitmapping), due to the special use scene of large-screen visualization, the details of graphics are blurred when traditional bitmaps are used, but the original detail clarity can be maintained after zooming in on vector graphics.


- **üöÄStable iteration and rapid response**

   This framework has gone through multiple version iterations, bug fixes are timely, function expansion is progressing steadily, and the Lite version and Premium are updated synchronously.

- **üßë‚ÄçüöÄCompletely free, use freely**
